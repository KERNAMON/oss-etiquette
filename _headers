# (??) When dealing with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is used to specify which origins are allowed to access resources on your server.

# Strict-Transport-Security
# Enforces HTTPS for the domain and its subdomains, with a long validity period (1 year)
# preload: Indicates readiness to be added to the HSTS preload list

#Content-Security-Policy controls resources loaded on the website, restricts scripts, styles and images to only those served from the same domain ('self'), while allowing inline image data (data:)

# X-Frame-Options prevents clickjacking by restricting the ability to embed your site in an <iframe>
# SAMEORIGIN: Allows framing only from the same origin.

# Permissions-Policy controls browser permissions for sensitive features like geolocation, microphone and camera.
# geolocation=(): Denies access to geolocation.
# microphone=(): Denies microphone access.
# camera=(): Denies camera access.
