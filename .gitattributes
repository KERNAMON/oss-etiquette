# Ensure Unix line endings (LF) are used across all files
* text=auto eol=lf

# Handle specific file types:
*.sh text eol=lf         # Shell scripts should use LF
*.html text eol=lf       # HTML files should use LF
*.css text eol=lf        # CSS files should use LF
*.js text eol=lf         # JavaScript files should use LF
*.xml text eol=lf        # XML files should use LF
*.json text eol=lf       # JSON files should use LF
*.txt text eol=lf        # Text files should use LF

# Mark binary files
*.jpg binary
*.png binary
*.gif binary
*.mp4 binary

# Ensure proper handling of markdown files
*.md text eol=lf

# Any configuration files?
*.conf text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf

#  Explanation of Key Settings:
#  * text=auto eol=lf: This makes sure that all files are normalized to use LF line endings, which is the standard on Linux systems.
#  *.sh text eol=lf: Forces shell scripts to use LF line endings.
#  *.html, *.css, *.js, *.xml, etc.: These are marked as text files that should consistently use LF.
#  *.jpg, *.png, *.gif, *.mp4: Binary files are explicitly set to be handled as binary, so Git doesn't attempt to alter line endings.
